If too low an amount of an enzyme is expressed in a multi-step reaction, the rate-limiting step will result in an inefficient reaction, but if too high an enzyme is expressed in a multi-part reaction, it will result in increased metabolic pressure on the cell due to excessive consumption of the carbon source as well as metabolic stress due to the buildup of the substrate. Therefore a suitably tunable multigene co-expression system is necessary.</p>"},{"location":"RAP_Builder/#prap-system","title":"pRAP system","text":"<p>There are two ways to implement multigene co-expression system,which are the multi-promoter co-expression strategy and the polycistronic co-expression strategy. Compared to the multi-promoter co-expression strategy, the polycistronic co-expression strategy is more suitable for synthetic biology because it requires minimal cargo DNA to deliver multiple genes and all genes complete their expression under one promoter1. Polycistronic expression also offers reproducible ratios of the proteins expressed, minimizing the impact on protein expression of the fluctuating transcription associated with multiple promoters because all genes are transcriptionally linked2. However, a major problem with polycistronic expression, which has two or more target genes under one promoter, is that the downstream genes express significantly lower than the first gene next to the promoter3,4.</p> <p>To solve this problem, our team proposed the Ribozyme-Assisted Polycistronic co-expression system (pRAP system) last year and won the 2022 Best New Basic Part. We develop pRAP system by sandwiching ribozyme sequences between CDSs instead of sequentially building CDSs. In pRAP, the hammerhead ribozyme's RNA sequences execute self-cleaving, leading in the co-transcriptional conversion of the polycistronic mRNA transcript into separate mono-cistrons in vivo.</p>"},{"location":"RAP_Builder/#establishing-rbs-strength","title":"Establishing RBS strength","text":"<p>Even though we discovered and demonstrated the pRAP system's functionality last year, we were only able to measure whether or not the RBS intensity needed to be increased or decreased. This year, we proposed a method for quantitatively evaluating optimal RBS intensity. Our method focuses on the balanced state of cellular metabolism and is based on the following assumptions:</p>"},{"location":"RAP_Builder/#assumption-1","title":"Assumption 1","text":"<p>The fluxes are balanced between each step of the linear reaction and can be expressed as follows:</p> \\[ flux_1 = flux_2 = ... = flux_n \\] <p>where \\(n\\) is the index of the reaction and \\(flux\\) means flux of the reaction. The significance of this assumption is that it prevents metabolic stress caused by flux imbalance and permits the cell to be in a state of flux balance.</p>"},{"location":"RAP_Builder/#assumption-2","title":"Assumption 2","text":"<p>The substrate should not be overstacked and should be kept more stationary, which we denote here as follows:</p> \\[ \\frac{[S_1]}{k_{m,1}} = \\frac{[S_2]}{k_{m,2}} = ... = \\frac{[S_n]}{k_{m,n}} \\] <p>where \\([S_n]\\) represents the concentration of the substrate of \\(reaction_n\\) and \\(k_{m,n}\\) represents the \\(k_m\\) value of reaction \\(n\\).</p> <p>From the Michaelis-Menten equation we could find:</p> \\[ v_n = \\frac{k_{cat,n}c_n[S_n]}{k_{m,n}+[S_n]}=\\frac{k_{cat,n}c_n}{\\frac{k_{m,n}}{[S_n]}+1} \\] <p>Where \\(c_n\\) is the concentration of the enzyme of \\(reaction_n\\) and \\(k_{cat,n},v_n\\) is the \\(k_{cat}\\) and velocity value of \\(reaction_n\\).</p> <p>and</p> \\[ flux_n = v_n \\times A_n \\] <p>where \\(A_n\\) is the ratio of product to substrate stoichiometry.</p> <p>Combining these equations and Assumption 1 we can conclude:</p> \\[ c_n\\propto\\frac{1}{A_nk_{cat,n}} \\] <p>From KineticHub we can easily search for \\(k_{cat}\\).
