Compared to Parthub, PartHub 2 has several new features:</p> <ul> <li>Update with 2022 iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Parthub 2 contains over 60,000 Parts, which is a huge leap up from Parthub.</li> <li>Improve the user interaction interface to further simplify the process of usage. PartHub 2 incorporates feedback and suggestions from PartHub users, removes unnecessary options and starts developing recommendation algorithms.</li> <li>Design a diversified recommendation algorithm based on graph algorithm. We developed a diversified recommendation algorithm based on PageRank and Louvain method to prioritize the appearance of more significant parts in the search results and avoid the recurrence of similar parts.</li> </ul> <p>The core of PartHub 2 is the graph model based on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. For each Part, in addition to the attributes (like name, sequence etc.) it carries, there are two types of relationships with other nodes: \"twins\" and \"refers to\". The \"twins\" are undirected, while the \"refers to\" are directed; each is a data structure known as graph, and their relationships may be represented by an adjacency matrix. PageRank and Louvain method is based on this graph model. PageRank reflects how actively a Part is used and Louvain enables community detection of similar Parts.</p> <p>We provide a summary of the notation.</p> Variable Description \\(d\\) damping factor which can be set between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) \\(Q\\) modularity of a graph \\(k_i,k_j\\) the sum of the weights of the edges attached to \\(community_i\\) and \\(community_j\\) \\(m\\) sum of all of the edge weights in the graph \\(c_i,c_j\\) communities of the nodes"},{"location":"PartHub2/#pagerank","title":"PageRank","text":"<p>The PageRank algorithm1 evaluates the relevance of each node in the network based on the number of incoming relationships and the importance of the associated source nodes.

PageRank is introduced as a function that solves the following equation:</p> \\[ PageRank(A) = (1-d)+d\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{PageRank(T_i)}{C(T_i)} \\] <p>where \\(C(A)\\) is the number of links going out of node A.

Phase 1 will put each node in a graph into a distinct community and optimize modularity by allowing only local changes to node-communities memberships. Phase 2 will aggregate communities into super-nodes to build a new network. The new network of super-nodes will then run Phase 1. Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be repeated until no movement yields a gain on the sum of modularity of all communities.</p>"},{"location":"PartHub2/#referenecs","title":"Referenecs","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Brin, S., &amp; Page, L.
